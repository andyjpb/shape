	* configure.in: Fixed a blooper that assumed that Tcl and Tk were
	installed in the same directory.

2000-09-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Changed to build correctly on Solaris (at least on
	my workstation...)  Also altered mechanism for guessing whether to
	support photo image shapes to use configure instead of testing
	what was defined in tkInt.h...

	* license.txt: Pulled this out into a single file.  Made all
	source files reference this one for license.

	* shape.test: Started work on writing a test suite.  Will need to
	continue on a Unix system so results - particularly of get
	operations - can be used to help write the suite...

	* shape.h: Altered KIND_* definitions to have a SHAPE_ prefix.

	* shapeInt.h: Created this file.  Shape_RenderTextAsRectangles now
	defined throuth this header and made "private" to the extension by
	changing its name, as its applicability to other domains is really
	small.  Other files updated to take account of this...
