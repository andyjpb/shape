Shaped Window Extension 0.4 for Tcl/Tk, Source Code Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This distribution is made under the terms described in the
"license.txt" file.

It allows a system that uses the Tk toolkit over the Tcl interpreter
(of at least version 8.0) to work with windows whose shapes are
described by other than a simple rectangle.

There is some documentation (both as NROFF source, with the tmac.an
macro package loaded, and PostScript as generated from that source
with GROFF) in the shape0.4/doc directory.

There are some demonstrations in the shape0.4/demos directory.

Any bug reports or feature suggestions are welcome; please send them
to the author at fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk  The author does not (at the
time of writing) provide commercial-level support for this software.

Note that this software should be considered to be of no better than
beta quality on Unix and alpha quality on Windows.  It is likely that
there will be a fair number more interim distributions like this one
before a full release.
