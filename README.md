Shaped Window Extension for Tcl/Tk
-----

This extension allows a system that uses the Tk toolkit over the Tcl interpreter
(of at least version 8.0) to work with windows whose shapes are
described by other than a simple rectangle.

There is some documentation (as NROFF source) in the `doc` directory.

There are some demonstrations in the `demos` directory.

Any bug reports or feature suggestions are welcome; pull requests welcome!

Note that this software should be considered to be of no better than
beta quality on Unix and alpha quality on Windows.

(OK, I put this code aside for a bit because I was busy with other
things. That "a bit" expanded to become 20 years...)
